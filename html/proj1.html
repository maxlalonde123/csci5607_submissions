        This was a tough project but I think I was able to get the requirements done correctly. One pain in the butt bug I had to deal with was with the translation feature.<br>
        My method was to check if the vector from the origin of the square to where I clocked intersected with any of the edges. If they didn't intersect I knew I was clicking<br>
        inside the square and that do_translate should be set to true. The problem was that seemingly randomly, the square would sometimes move when I was clicking outside of the<br>
        square. The problem ended up being a floating point precision bug. When I was clicking outside of the square it would sometime register inside the square because coordinate<br>
        values that should have been equal were actually registering as unequal causing errors. Other difficulties I encountered included figuring out how to get GL to not display<br>
        the texture upside down, adjusting the brightness, and adjusting the brightness by pressing a button.
